# Google Code Jam 2019 Qualification Round
This is my answer guess for answers. Really smooth ride at first 2 problems, but the third problem have been giving me runtime error all the time even though I'm quite confident that I code it right(?)

## TODO :
- I will try to ask around later why my code for problems 3 (Cryptopangrams) give me Runtime Error.
- I should have understand interactive problems for the next round, there should be at least one problem in that style.

### What I learn :
- For some reason, GCJ compiler for python 3 behave differently compared with my system, I don't know what cause this... different version of Python?
