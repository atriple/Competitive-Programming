## Graphs(V-E)
We can represents graph in two ways :
* Adjacency List -- for sparse graph
* Adjacency Matrix  -- for dense graph

Notes :
* It should have symmetrical relationship for undirected graph

### Special Graphs : Grid
This graph can be simply represented as matrix, the edge always assumed to connect with its neighbor (horizontal / vertical / diagnoal; depends on the rules).
