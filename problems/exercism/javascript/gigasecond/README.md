## Notes
In this problems, we learn about Javascript `Date`. Here's good reference for it https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date

Here's some quickie :
- `Date.UTC(Year, MonthIndex, Day)` : generate UTC number (integer milisecond after UNIX epoch).
- `Date.parse(dateString)` : parse string of date in this format http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15
- `Date.prototype.valueOf()` : turn instance of Date into value in UTC number.
